dielectric mixture
==========

A python script for the calculation of the effective dielectric constant for a homogeneous mixture 
within the effective medium approximation. 

Current status
--------------

* Asks user to input values of dielectric constant for bulk crystal and a medium
* Takes values for dielectric constants and calculates the effective dielectric constant for a range 
  of packing densities (assuming spherical particles)
* Output prints a table of packing density and effective dielectric constants
* A graph is plotted of effective dielectric constant as a function of packing density
